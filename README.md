Types of recommendation system
Popularity Based
It keeps a track of view counts for each movie/video and then lists movies based on views in descending order.

Content Based
This type of recommendation systems, takes in a movie that a user currently likes as input. Then it analyzes the contents of the movie to find out other movies which have similar content. Then it ranks similar movies according to their similarity scores and recommends the most relevant movies to the user.

Collaborative filtering
In other words, the recommendations get filtered based on the collaboration between similar userâ€™s preferences.

In this notebook we are going to implement content based recommendation system.
